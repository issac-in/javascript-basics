    <h1>3 Buttons, 3 Ways of alerting "Hello World" when clicked</h1>
    <p>Note that all 3 of these methods can be used with named functions</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using named functions can clean up your code considerably, and is a really good idea if the function is something that you are going to want to do in multiple pieces.</li>
        <li>With all three methods, we can access more information about the event by passing a parameter to the function that we are calling.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Less than ideal, because we're cluttering the HTML w/ JS. -->
    <!-- Also, we can only have 1 "onclick" event per element. -->
    <!-- <button onclick="alert('Hello World')">Method 1 - Click Me</button> -->

    <!-- We moved the JS out of the HTML into an JS file, which is good. -->
    <!-- We can still only have 1 "onclick" event per element though. -->
    <!-- <button id="btn-2">Method 2 - Click Me</button> -->

    <!-- Method 3 is much more flexible & powerful, but is more complex to set up. -->
    <!-- Allows separation of concerns, and allows multiple event listeners as needed. -->
    <!-- <button id="btn-3">Method 3 - Click Me Too</button> -->

    <div id="container">
        <button id="1">Click Me</button>
        <button id="2">Click Me</button>
        <button id="3">Click Me</button>
